ocean.py: a Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, and consume data.

Maintainability Test Coverage

Ocean.py helps data scientists earn $ from their AI models, track provenance of data & compute, and get more data. (More details here.)

Ocean.py makes these tasks easy:

Publish data services: data feeds, REST APIs, downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 data NFT for each service, and ERC20 datatoken for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
Sell datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
Transfer data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions using web3.py.
ocean.py is part of the Ocean Protocol toolset.

This is in beta state. If you run into problems, please open up a new issue.

üèÑ Quickstart
Follow these steps in sequence to ramp into Ocean.

Install Ocean
Setup:
Remote (Win, MacOS, Linux)
or Local (Linux only)
Walk through main flow: publish asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it
Tools
Define gas strategy - auto-determine gas fee for remote networks
Search & filter data - find assets by tag
Custody-light flow - consume a free & a priced asset without custody
Use-case flows
Challenge DF - prize $$ to predict future ETH price
Data Farming - curate data assets, earn rewards
On-chain key-value store via data NFTs
Sharing public data on-chain - e.g. public AI models
Sharing private data on-chain - e.g. private AI models
More types of data assets
Each of the following shows how to publish & consume a particular type of data.

C2D - tokenize & monetize AI algorithms via Compute-to-Data
REST API - Example on Binance ETH price feed
GraphQL - Example on Ocean Data NFTs
On-chain data - Example on Ocean swap fees
Adding credentials - Example on publishing an asset with custom credentials
